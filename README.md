## Getting set up with Daily

To use this demo, you will need a Daily room to join.

To get a Daily room URL, [create a Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup).

Once you have an account and are logged into the [Daily Dashboard](https://dashboard.daily.co), you can [create a new Daily room](https://dashboard.daily.co/rooms/create).

Copy the new room's URL. You can use this in the form on the home page.

The room URL will be in the following format:

`https://<your-daily-domain>.daily.co/<room-name>`

## Features

This demo demonstrates how to build a video call in Vue with the following features:

- multi-participant calls
- local participant controls to:
  - control camera and microphone devices
  - share your screen (a limit of 1 screen share at a time is enforced here for simplicity)
  - leave the current call
- join any Daily call
- set your username before joining the call

### Ideas for expanding this demo

Some features that could be added to this demo include:

- Adding [prejoin UI](https://www.daily.co/blog/build-your-own-prejoin-call-ui-in-a-custom-daily-video-chat-app/) to test devices and see your local video before joining
- Allowing users to create rooms via the app using Daily's [REST API](https://docs.staging.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms)
- Managing meeting permissions via [room settings](https://docs.staging.daily.co/guides/controlling-who-joins-a-meeting), like making the call a [broadcast call](https://www.daily.co/blog/daily-prebuilt-broadcast-call-deep-dive/)
